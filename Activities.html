<H2>Activities</H2>
<p>I am a person who loves sports and living a healthy life. My biggest passion is fixing things and building different types of aircraft with Lego. I’ve also spent a lot of time playing flight simulators because flying is something I’ve always been passionate about.</p> 
 
<p>I’m a very creative person, I enjoy writing stories, watching movies, and imagining my own worlds. I also love playing basketball. When I was 16, I played for a team called Queluz in Portugal. I used to compete in swimming too, but nowadays I do both just for fun.</p>
<p>I don’t mind working on myself, and I always give my best in everything I do. I speak Portuguese fluently, and I am always ready to learn, and I don’t mind doing overtime.</p>
